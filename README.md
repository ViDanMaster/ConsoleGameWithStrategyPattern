Text-Based RPG Game with Strategy Pattern Implementation (Work in Progress)
This project demonstrates the application of the Strategy pattern in a text-based RPG game. 

The game currently features:

Character Classes: Players can choose from different character classes, each with unique abilities and strategies.

Weapon and Spell Behavior: Weapons and spells are implemented using the Strategy pattern, allowing for dynamic and flexible combat interactions.

Turn-Based Combat: Players engage in turn-based battles, strategically using their characters' abilities to defeat opponents.



Planned enhancements:

Graphical User Interface (GUI): A GUI will be implemented to enhance the user experience and provide a more visually engaging gameplay.

Expanded Weapon and Spell Arsenal: A wider variety of weapons and spells will be added to offer more strategic depth and combat options.

Potion and Consumable Items: Potions and other consumable items will be introduced to provide additional tactical elements during battles.

Character Progression and Customization: Players will have the opportunity to develop and customize their characters, fostering a sense of progression and player agency.



My learning objectives:

Strategy Pattern Implementation: Understand and apply the Strategy pattern to decouple algorithms from objects and enhance code flexibility.

Object-Oriented Design: Employ object-oriented principles to structure the game's code, promoting maintainability and extensibility.
